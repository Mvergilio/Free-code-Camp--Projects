This is a documentation page, where I will be putting everything that I've learned at freecodecamp to use. I'll be trying to use the GRID  layout to create a very good looking page. This is basically the third out of five projects that needs to be built in order to conquer the responsive web design course.
 
 
 So,  I will be  developing a CSS grid documentation  page, where I'll be trying to learn CSS grid layout and implementing it at the same time.

I am trying to make this get commited to github.
