                <h2>Basic Concepts of grid layout</h2>
            </header>
            <p>CSS Grid Layout introduces a two-dimensional grid system to CSS. Grids can be used to lay out major page areas or small user interface elements. This article introduces the CSS Grid Layout and the new terminology that is part of the CSS Grid Layout Level 1 specification. The features shown in this overview will then be explained in greater detail in the rest of this guide.</p>

                <h3>What is grid?</h3>
               <p>A grid is a set of intersecting horizontal and vertical lines defining columns and rows. Elements can be placed onto the grid within these column and row lines. CSS grid layout has the following features:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fixed and flexible track sizes</li>
                    <li>Item placement</li>
                    <li>Creation of additional tracks to hold content</li>
                    <li>Alignment control</li>
                    <li>Control of overlapping content</li>

                <h2>The Grid container</h2>
            </header>
            <p>We create a grid container by declaring <code>display: grid</code> or <code>display: inline-grid </code> on an element. As soon as we do this, all <span>direct children</span> of that element become <span>grid items</span>.</p>
            <img src="images/fisrt code example.png" alt="HTML code example display a div and its divs children">
            <p>In this example, I have a containing <code>div</code> with a class of wrapper and, inside are five child elements.</p>
        
            <p>I make the <span>.wrapper</span> a grid container.</p>

                <h2>Grid tracks</h2>
            </header>
            <p>We define rows and columns on our grid with the <code>grid-template-columns</code> and <code>grid-template-rows</code> properties. These define grid tracks. A grid track is the space between any two lines on the grid. In the below image you can see a track highlighted – this is the first row track in our grid.</p>

            <h3>Basic example</h3>
            <p>I can add to our earlier example by adding the grid-template-columns property, then defining the size of the column tracks.</p>
            <p>I have now created a grid with three 200-pixel-wide column tracks. The child items will be laid out on this grid one in each grid cell.</p>

            <header>
                <h2>Grid lines</h2>
            </header>
            <p>It should be noted that when we define a grid we define the grid tracks, not the lines. Grid then gives us numbered lines to use when positioning items. In our three column, two row grid we have four column lines.</p>

            <img src="images/GRID lines.png" alt="Image showing how grid lines would work.">
            <p>Lines are numbered according to the writing mode of the document. In a left-to-right language, line 1 is on the left-hand side of the grid. In a right-to-left language, it is on the right-hand side of the grid. Lines can also be named, and we will look at how to do this in a later guide in this series.</p>

                <h2>Grid cells</h2>
            </header>
                <p>A grid cell is the smallest unit on a grid. Conceptually it is like a table cell. As we saw in our earlier examples, once a grid is defined as a parent the child items will lay themselves out in one cell each of the defined grid. In the below image, I have highlighted the first cell of the grid.</p>

            <header>
                <h2>Grid areas</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Items can span one or more cells both by row or by column, and this creates a grid area. Grid areas must be rectangular – it isn’t possible to create an L-shaped area for example. The highlighted grid area spans two row and two column tracks.</p>

       <section class="main-section" id="Gutters">
        <header>
            <h2>Gutters</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Gutters or alleys between grid cells can be created using the <code>column-gap</code> and <code>row-gap</code> properties, or the shorthand <code>gap</code>. In the below example, I am creating a 10-pixel gap between columns and a 1em gap between rows.</p>
            <img src="images/Gutters1.png" alt="CSS style of the gutters">
            <img src="images/Gutters2.png" alt="HTML of the gutters">
             <img src="images/Gutters3.png" alt="results of the HTML and CSS style showing how gutters works">
        
        <p>Any space used by gaps will be accounted for before space is assigned to the flexible length fr tracks, and gaps act for sizing purposes like a regular grid track, however you cannot place anything into a gap. In terms of line-based positioning, the gap acts like a thick line.</p>

            <h2>Nesting grids</h2>
        </header>
        <p>A grid item can become a grid container. In the following example, I have the three-column grid that I created earlier, with our two positioned items. In this case the first item has some sub-items. As these items are not direct children of the grid they do not participate in grid layout and so display in a normal document flow.</p>
